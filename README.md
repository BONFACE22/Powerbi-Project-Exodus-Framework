# Powerbi-Project-Exodus-Framework
The Exodus Framework outlines a structured approach to building a Power BI project, from data extraction to visualization and publishing. This framework ensures an organized workflow that enables efficient data handling and insightful reporting. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

## Data Extraction: 
Begin by gathering data from various external sources such as ERP systems, Excel files, CSV datasets, and more. These data sources may come from different departments or platforms that are integral to the project scope.

## Data Loading into Power BI:
Load the extracted data into Power BI, ensuring all relevant datasets are included. This step integrates data from various sources, making them available for further processing within Power BI.

## ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) in Power Query: Use Power Query to perform the ETL process. Here, you'll:

Clean and transform the raw data, correcting any inconsistencies or missing values.
Shape the data according to project requirements, preparing it for analysis. This step ensures that the data is well-organized and ready for modeling.
## Data Modeling and DAX Measures:
Create relationships between different data tables in Data Modeling to build a cohesive structure. Afterward, build calculations and metrics using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to generate insights, such as calculated columns, measures, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Visualization: Design and implement visual reports and dashboards. Use Power BI’s wide range of visualization tools to:

Present key insights through charts, graphs, tables, and interactive elements.
Focus on making the data digestible and actionable for end users, using visual storytelling to highlight trends, comparisons, and patterns.
Publishing: Finally, publish the reports to Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration. Users can access live reports, interact with the data, and explore real-time insights through published dashboards.

The Exodus Framework ensures a comprehensive, structured process for creating powerful data-driven insights with Power BI, from data extraction to impactful visualizations
